// Problem:11

// Old macdonald had a farm:
// MacDonald is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
// turkey = 2 legs
// horse = 4 legs
// pigs = 4 legs

// The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

// Examples
// CountAnimals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36
// CountAnimals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22
// CountAnimals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
function CountAnimals(tur,horse,pigs)
 {
    return (2*tur + 4*horse +4* pigs);
}
 let legs = CountAnimals(2,3,5)
 console.log(legs);
 legs = CountAnimals(1,2,3)
 console.log(legs);
 legs = CountAnimals(5,2,8)
 console.log(legs);
